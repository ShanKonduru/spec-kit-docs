# Constitution

This document establishes the core principles and non-negotiable rules for the project. These principles will guide all development decisions, ensuring a high-quality, maintainable, and effective system.

## 1. Quality Standards

### Code Quality

All code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python. It must be well-documented with clear docstrings for all functions and classes.

### Testing

All components must have a minimum of 90% test coverage. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are required for each major feature.

All tests must have proper pytest mark annotations.

All tests must be marked as Positive, Negative, and Edge cases.

All tests must have Arrange, Act, Assert structure.

All tests must have code coverage reports generated and reviewed.

All tests must be run in a clean environment to ensure reliability.

All tests must run using mocking.

All integration tests must have provision to run live.

### Performance Budgets

- The Metrics Collector component must have a minimal resource footprint to avoid impacting the performance of the monitored AI agents.
- The Performance Metrics Collection REST API must be able to handle at least 1,000 requests per second with an average latency of under 50ms.
- The Dashboard's data loading time must be under 3 seconds on a stable network connection.

### Security Standards

- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- Authentication and authorization must be implemented for all API endpoints.
- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
- All communications must use TLS 1.3 or higher for data in transit.
- Security vulnerabilities must be scanned and addressed in CI/CD pipelines.
- Regular security audits must be conducted quarterly.

## 2. User Experience Consistency

### Simplicity

The UI must be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### Clarity

Visualizations (graphs, charts) must be clear, well-labeled, and easy to interpret.

### Responsiveness

The UI must be fully responsive and function correctly on desktop and tablet devices. Mobile support is a non-goal for the initial release.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Principles

### Modularity

The system must be built with a modular architecture, allowing for individual components to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Open Source First

All software components will be built using open-source technologies and libraries.

### Immutability

Data stored in the PostgreSQL database is immutable. Updates to metrics will be handled by adding new records, not modifying existing ones.

## 4. Performance & Scalability

### Performance Monitoring

- All critical system components must have performance metrics collection and real-time monitoring.
- Performance degradation alerts must be configured with appropriate thresholds.
- Performance baselines must be established and maintained for all major features.

### Scalability Requirements

- The system architecture must support horizontal scaling for increased load.
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing and query analysis.
- Caching strategies must be implemented for frequently accessed data.

### Resource Optimization

- Memory usage must be monitored and optimized to prevent leaks.
- CPU-intensive operations must be profiled and optimized.
- Network bandwidth usage must be minimized through efficient data transfer.

## 5. Data Management

### Data Retention

- Data retention policies must be clearly defined for each data type.
- Automated data archival processes must be implemented for historical data.
- Data purging procedures must comply with regulatory requirements.

### Backup & Recovery

- Automated daily backups must be performed with verification.
- Recovery procedures must be tested quarterly.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) must not exceed 4 hours.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) must not exceed 1 hour.

### Data Privacy & Compliance

- Personal data must be handled in compliance with GDPR and applicable regulations.
- Data access must be logged and auditable.
- Data anonymization procedures must be implemented where required.

## 6. Development Workflow

### Version Control

- All code must be version controlled using Git with semantic versioning.
- Branch protection rules must be enforced for main/production branches.
- Commit messages must follow conventional commit standards.

### Code Review

- All code changes must undergo peer review before merging.
- Code reviews must verify adherence to coding standards and security practices.
- Automated code quality checks must pass before review approval.

### CI/CD Standards

- Automated testing must run on all pull requests.
- Deployment pipelines must include security scanning and quality gates.
- Feature flags must be used for gradual rollouts of new features.

## 7. Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Standards

- All applications must implement structured logging with consistent format.
- Log levels must be appropriately used (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
- Sensitive information must never be logged in plain text.
- Log retention policies must align with compliance requirements.

### Error Handling

- All errors must be properly caught, logged, and handled gracefully.
- User-facing error messages must be clear and actionable.
- Critical errors must trigger immediate alerts to the development team.
- Error tracking and monitoring must be implemented across all components.

### Health Checks

- All services must implement health check endpoints.
- Health checks must verify dependencies and critical functionality.
- Health status must be monitored and alerting configured for failures.

## 8. API Design Standards

### RESTful Standards

- APIs must follow RESTful principles and HTTP method semantics.
- API responses must use appropriate HTTP status codes.
- API endpoints must be consistently named and structured.
- API documentation must be automatically generated and kept up-to-date.

### Versioning Strategy

- API versioning must be implemented to ensure backward compatibility.
- Breaking changes must be introduced only in new major versions.
- Deprecation notices must be provided with migration timelines.

### Rate Limiting & Security

- Rate limiting must be implemented to prevent abuse.
- API authentication must be required for all endpoints.
- Input validation must be performed on all API requests.
- API access must be logged for security auditing.

## 9. Governance

### Principle Enforcement

Adherence to these principles will be verified during code reviews and through automated CI/CD checks.

### Decision Making

Any proposed changes to these core principles must be approved by the project lead and documented with a clear rationale.
